NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
*Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software.
*NLP is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. 
*The study of natural language processing has been around for more than 50 years and grew out of the field of linguistics with the rise of computers


WHAT IS A NATURAL LANGUAGE?
-A natural language is any language that has evolved naturally in humans through use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation.EG English, Spanish
-refers to the way we, humans, communicate with each other.
-We are surrounded by text.

-Everything we express (either verbally or in written) carries huge amounts of information.
he topic we choose, our tone, our selection of words, everything adds some type of information that can be interpreted and value extracted from it. 
In theory, we can understand and even predict human behaviour using that information.

-But there is a problem: one person may generate hundreds or thousands of words in a declaration, each sentence with its corresponding complexity. 
If you want to scale and analyze several hundreds, thousands or millions of people or declarations in a given geography, then the situation is unmanageable.

-Data generated from conversations, declarations or even tweets are examples of unstructured data. 
Unstructured data doesn’t fit neatly into the traditional row and column structure of relational databases, 
and represent the vast majority of data available in the actual world. It is messy and hard to manipulate. 

-Nevertheless, thanks to the advances in disciplines like machine learning a big revolution is going on regarding this topic. 
Nowadays it is no longer about trying to interpret a text or speech based on its keywords (the old fashioned mechanical way), 
but about understanding the meaning behind those words (the cognitive way).

Think about how much text you see each day:
Signs
Menus
Email
SMS
Web Pages
and so much more

APPLICATIONS OF NLP
1.NLP enables the recognition and prediction of diseases based on electronic health records and patient’s own speech. 
This capability is being explored in health conditions that go from cardiovascular diseases to depression and even schizophrenia.
 For example, Amazon Comprehend Medical is a service that uses NLP to extract disease conditions, medications and treatment outcomes from patient notes,
 clinical trial reports and other electronic health records.

2.Organizations can determine what customers are saying about a service or product by identifying and extracting information in sources like social media. 
This sentiment analysis can provide a lot of information about customers choices and their decision drivers.

3.Companies like Yahoo and Google filter and classify your emails with NLP by analyzing text in emails that flow through their servers and stopping spam 
before they even enter your inbox.

4.To help identifying fake news, the NLP Group at MIT developed a new system to determine if a source is accurate or politically biased, detecting 
if a news source can be trusted or not.
